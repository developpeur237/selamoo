The easiest way to add SVG animations to your website right from your SVGator account.

== Description ==

Import your SVG files created in [SVGator](https://www.svgator.com) to your WordPress media library and use them as normal image files. This plugin lets you comfortably access all your animation projects and makes it super-easy to add them to your page. You are free to choose an SVG with either CSS or JavaScript as the animation type.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are constantly growing in popularity due to their scalability, small size, and responsiveness. They are ideal for illustrations like logos, icons, buttons, and graphs. Animated SVG files make your page unique, interactive, and look crisp on any device.

SVGator is an incredibly useful and innovative SVG animation tool that lets you create stunning SVG animations without any coding skills. Import your SVG and choose from a series of advanced animator tools that let you generate amazing animations in just minutes. Spice up your website or blog with impressive SVG animations to increase user engagement. The user-friendly drag and drop interface simplifies the animation process and the code is automatically generated either in CSS or in Javascript.

== Usage ==

You can check out our documentation with screenshots on our help page: [How to use SVGator Plugin for WordPress](https://www.svgator.com/help/getting-started/wordpress-svgator-plugin)

Before starting to use the Wordpress plug-in, you will have to sign up for the SVGator app. After creating an account, you can import your SVG files and start working on them to turn your static designs into dynamic and interactive animations.

When you are done with the animation, you can fully benefit from the plugin. There is no need to export or convert your work, just follow these simple steps:
1.	Find and install the SVGator plugin
2.	Activate the plugin
3.	Log in to load your projects from SVGator and authorize the app
4.	Select an animation project from your SVGator library and add it to the media library
5.	Add an animated SVG block to your post or page by clicking the SVGator icon on the `new block` tool.
6.  Select the animated SVG from the media library and scale it to any size without losing quality
7.  Alternatively you can import your SVGs directly on the media library box, under "Import from SVGator" tab

You can also use the animations inside widgets by simply adding the `SVGator` widget to your sidebars or footers.

**Note:** When you import your animation to the page, you may find it in a <img> tag in the editor, but you don’t have to worry about this. Although theoretically, this would mean the animation might not work the same as in SVGator, (especially if it's an interactive SVG), in preview mode you will already find it inline and it will work perfectly.

== Security ==

By authorizing the plugin you acknowledge that WordPress will have access to your SVGator library and is enabled to list and export the animations created in your account.

You can remove the plugin at any time by clicking on SVGator’s Account settings under your name, then choosing the 3rd Party Apps tab and deleting the plugin. If you would like to add it back, you will have to follow the steps presented above.
